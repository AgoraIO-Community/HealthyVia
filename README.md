## HealthyVia, a virtual Emergency Medical Technician service for the people during medical emergencies through video call. 

Website: healthyvia.com 

## Problem:
The people who live in rural areas and who don't have better access to emergency services like ambulance always bring the victims to the hospital without providing/following emergency medical protocols, due to which the survival rate of the victims getting admitted to their hospital is very less or makes it harder for the doctors to provide proper treatment.

## Solution:
HealthyVia connects a victim who is having a medical emergency like heart-stroke, trauma, breathlessness etc... with a virtual emergency medical technician or an emergency medicine doctor along with victim's family responders on a group video call who could help the victim with emergency medical protocols by the time ambulance or EMTs arrive at the victim.

P.S. It will be designed in such a way that people use this platform during waiting time after calling for an ambulance.

## Available Variations:
